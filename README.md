## Project Overview:
This project aims how accurately can machine learning models predict customer booking preferences and cancellations based on previous bookings?  
We used machine learning models like **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **SVM** to classify cancellations.


## Important libraries to be loaded:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
scipy
- **For Hyperparameter tuning we imported libraries like**
GridSearchCV


## Dataset
- The dataset contains information about hotel bookings such as:
  - Lead time
  - Hotel type
  - Arrival Date 
  - Number of special requests
  - Stay duration (weekends and weekdays)
  - Customer type
  - Deposit type
  - and more.

## Preprocessing
- Handled missing and duplicate values.
- Encoded categorical variables.
- Removed outliers using the IQR method.

## Data Visualization
The following visualization strategies were applied in this project:
•	Bar Chart 
•	Pie Chart
•	Clustered Bar Chart
•	Line Graph
•	Heatmap

## Models Used
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Confusion matrix**
- **Accuracy**
- **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

##  And Finally discussed the results

Amongst all the models XGBoost performed the best!
